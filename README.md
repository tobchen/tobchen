You never see Batman, Bruce Wayne, and me in the same room but I assure you that I'm neither a psychotic vigilante nor a capitalist playboy.

* 👨‍💻 I write primarily C or Python, sometimes Java, though I occasionally pretend to know C++ or Rust
* 🖥️ Common project types: games & graphics, screenwriting, artist tools
* 💾 Every now and then, I dabble in "older" software (e.g. DOS, Motif) for its own sake
* 🖼️ Find my art on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tobchende/ "Toby's Insta")
* 🐱 Cats > dogs
